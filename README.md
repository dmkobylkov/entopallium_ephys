Here you can find raw data and the corresponding R-script for analysis and vizualization of neural responses in the Entopallium of young domestic chicks. The raw data are divided into Light incubated and Dark incubated condition. The spikes were summed in 25ms bins for each trial and recorded unit. The data in the long and wide format are averaged for the number of trials.

If you download the data files and unpack them, you can run the .Rmd script to reproduce the results and figures.
